# Muove decisions

This file records the decisions made for the MVP, the three that Tom made,
and how each review finding was resolved.

## 1. Decisions made

Each decision gives its evidence and, under "Rejected", the alternatives
considered. Evidence IDs refer to SPEC.md Appendix A, and `A-` IDs to its
Appendix B.

### D-1. A new Rust workspace in `~/code/muove/main`

Muove is built fresh, porting the prototype pieces listed in P6.

Rejected:

- **Grow Clause.** It is about 120k Rust LOC, stalled after 29 repins in 5
  days, and carries five P0 audit findings (N8).
- **Grow Beagle.** Racket costs 1.8 s per file to start, it has 17 recorded
  silent miscompiles, and its surface has been migrated repeatedly (F11,
  F13).
- **Grow the prototype in place.** It is positive-only Datalog with a naive
  engine, three critical review bugs and no value language (P2, P4, P5).

### D-2. Scope: rules and data, not general-purpose effects

Muove owns firn's declarative and decision layer (modules, hosts, tags,
responsibilities, flake inputs and command plans) and north's state machine.
Mechanics stay in host languages: firn's 59 `.bjs` files, and north's
terminal, process and transport code (F12, N6).

Rejected:

- **Muove as a general-purpose language.** That is Beagle's scope, and the
  surface churn it caused (F13).

### D-3. State consistency through explicit state and events

Derived rules are evaluated within one state. Events are the only transitions.
Temporal claims are answered by explicit-state breadth-first search with
stated bounds (SPEC §5, R1, A-Dedalus, A-Alloy6).

Rejected:

- **Timestamps written by users** (Dedalus `@next` by hand): hard to read
  (A-Dedalus, where the critique comes from the source itself).
- **ASP or SAT planning in the MVP:** grounding blowup and unpredictable
  semantics (A-telingo).
- **Static reachability with "journey" annotations:** these do not carry
  over to north.

### D-4. Three-valued verdicts everywhere

`Unknown` never approves, and `check` exits 2 on it (R5–R8).

Rejected:

- **A boolean plus a status flag:** in the prototype these drifted apart in
  four places.

### D-5. `requires` means counterfactual dependence; strength means minimum failure set

Rejected:

- **Counting supports** (R4).
- **`requires` as proof-structure dependence under negation:** it is
  ill-defined once rules can be blocked through `not`.

### D-6. Lazy proofs of minimal height by default

Exhaustive supports are `--all`, and bounded (A-Souffle, A-KR2026).

Rejected:

- **Eager enumeration of all supports** (R13, R18).

### D-7. Two stages; Muove never evaluates Nix

Muove values are either known at Muove compile time or `Nix` terms, which are
type-checked and emitted unevaluated (SPEC §3.2).

Rejected:

- **Embedding a Nix evaluator** such as snix or tvix: very large, and it
  would make Muove answerable for Nix semantics.
- **Untyped pass-through of Nix:** Beagle issue #14 shows how that lets
  values bypass checks (F13).

### D-8. Migration proofs

- **Beagle output:** byte-identical files.
- **Clause modules:** parse-identical Nix, each listed with whether
  whiterabbit's drvPath covers it.
- **whiterabbit:** an unchanged toplevel drvPath. nixos-config verifies only
  whiterabbit; ashashi is nix-darwin, and its drvPath is reported where it
  evaluates on Linux.
- **north:** replay under the observation contract of SPEC §10.4.

The drvPath is a sound check because no host embeds the flake revision
(F15).

Rejected:

- **The drvPath alone:** a module that no evaluated host enables is
  invisible to it.
- **Parse identity alone for Beagle output:** `"" + x` and `"${x}"` parse
  differently, and they behave differently when `x` is a path.
- **Comparing evaluated option values:** that needs a custom evaluator.

### D-9. Module metadata as facts in the module's own file

Tags, opt-ins, tag overrides and flake inputs are written as facts beside the
module (SPEC §9.6).

Rejected:

- **184 separate `tags.clause` files** (F2).
- **Stripping metadata out of emitted Nix by text surgery** (F5).

### D-10. Declared sentence templates plus a record register chosen by block headers

SPEC §9.2 and §9.3.

Rejected:

- **S-expressions:** Beagle's surface had to be migrated again and again
  (F13), and the thesis is readability.
- **Free English:** "naturalness is an illusion" (A-Inform7).

### D-11. Vocabularies scoped by module, and explicit quantifiers

Rejected:

- **Global shapes:** importing an unrelated model broke an existing line
  (R16).
- **An implicit "some":** R15.

### D-12. `Int` only, no floating point

Rejected:

- **F64:** north uses it only as a workaround for missing integers (N3).

### D-13. Entities with records, create and delete, and derived relations

These replace maintenance handlers.

Rejected:

- **Clause's model**, which forces 6 maintenance handlers after every
  transition and 8-relation manual teardowns (N3).

### D-14. No match rejects by default

A handler opts into the empty step with `may skip`. `muove import clause`
marks every imported handler `may skip`, so the import keeps Clause's
behaviour until each marker is removed under replay (D-28).

Rejected:

- **Clause's silent empty delta:** north needs 12 Rust postcondition
  re-checks because of it (N2, N4).

### D-15. Effects are typed requests; outcomes come back as receipt events

`at most one per step` keeps the mailbox's rule that competing requests
reject the step, and `settled by` defines which requests are pending after a
restore (SPEC §5.4).

Rejected:

- **A single-slot mailbox** (N3).
- **Effectful Muove code:** it would break replay.

### D-16. A naive reference interpreter beside the fast engine, with differential tests

Rejected:

- **Oracle tests that call the production engine** (R14).

### D-17. Generated Rust bindings for north

Rejected:

- **Dynamic relation tables marshaled by hand:** about 2,200 boundary lines
  today (N4).

### D-18. Frozen baselines, restricted patches and checked `intends` contracts

Rejected:

- **Concatenating the base and the proposal source:** the proposal could
  approve itself (R9).

### D-19. Fixtures from nixos-config and north are read in place

They are never copied into this repository, which keeps Tom's private
configuration out of a repository he may publish.

### D-20. Dependencies only where they replace an external-format or protocol implementation

`rnix` parses Nix in dev tools and tests, and `lsp-server`/`lsp-types` serve
the LSP. The core crates stay dependency-free.

Rejected:

- **Zero dependencies everywhere:** that means writing a Nix parser.

### D-21. The first rewrite is nixos-config `modules/kanata`

The pair is `default.bnix` (28 LOC) and `kanata.bnix` (29 LOC), and Beagle
reproduces both byte-identically today (F14). Runners-up: `modules/users`
and `modules/firefox`.

### D-22. The first north slice is the menu, `north.clause` L447–827

Fallback: the references slice (N10).

### D-23. File extension `.muove`

Rejected:

- **`.mv`:** the Move language already uses it.

### D-24. Container layout

`main/inputs/` holds the imported inputs as source next to the original zips.
The prototype's two-commit history stays inside `claude-muove.zip`.

Rejected:

- **Nesting the prototype's `.git`:** it would create an embedded repository.

### D-25. `nix file` is the general output form; `nix module` is its special case

The flake root, `providerAdapter` and overlays are Nix values, not module
items (SPEC §10.2).

Rejected:

- **Keeping `flake.nix` outside Muove:** north's `flake.clause` and
  `flake.nix` are already kept in lockstep by hand (N7).
- **A separate flake language:** two output forms over one Nix AST.

### D-26. Event slots are closed (`only in`) or open (`sampled from`)

A universal claim over an open slot is `Unknown`, with the sampled result as
evidence (SPEC §5.5).

Rejected:

- **Enumerating every Text slot:** north's menu query text cannot be
  enumerated.
- **Holds over samples:** the reviewed spec let a search over `"ok"` prove
  `never compromised` while the runtime admitted `"boom"`.

### D-27. Beagle's tools: replaced, except the repair pipeline

`muove import nix` replaces `beagle-import-nix`, `muove rename option`
replaces `beagle-rename`, and `muove refs`, `muove build --stdout`,
`muove review` and `muove schema explain` replace the compiler queries.
The evidence-ranked repair pipeline is dropped. PLAN box 4.9 checks for
callers before Beagle leaves the build.

Rejected:

- **Porting the repair pipeline:** ranking repairs for a failed compile is
  what Muove's did-you-mean, closest-shape diagnostics and the review gate
  already do, and no caller is known.

### D-28. North migrates mechanically first, then refactors under replay

The importer keeps Clause's behaviour: every handler `may skip`,
maintenance handlers kept in order, FIFO rules as written, and the mailbox
as `at most one per step`. Each move to SPEC §9.7's end state is a separate
change that must replay identically.

Rejected:

- **Importing straight to the end state:** maintenance handlers run at
  different points from derived relations, so a sequence can read a stale
  value in Clause and a current one in Muove, and an empty move rejects
  instead of skipping.

### D-29. Review compares failing instances, not verdicts

Rejected:

- **Comparing verdicts by requirement name:** a requirement that already
  failed for host A hides a new failure for host B.

### D-30. Invariants and `ensures` take state claims only

Rejected:

- **Temporal invariants:** admission would depend on itself. With
  `invariant every Clock ticks happens when Clock is ready`, admitting the
  tick breaks the invariant, and rejecting it satisfies the invariant.

### D-31. Ids are never reused, and the allocator is part of the state

Rejected:

- **Reusing ids:** an outstanding receipt can still name a deleted entity.
- **Searching up to id renaming:** it is sound when renaming keeps the order
  of ids, but it is a symmetry reduction, which waits until a search needs
  it (SPEC §12).

### D-32. Fixtures are pinned worktrees at named commits

Rejected:

- **Reading nixos-config and north `main` live:** the oracle would change as
  the migration lands.

## 2. Decisions Tom made

The orchestrator relayed Tom's choices on 2026-10-10: he took the
recommendation on all three.

### T1. firn's mechanics move to TypeScript on Bun

firn's 59 `.bjs` files hold 23,268 LOC (F12). When Beagle's JavaScript
retires, they become TypeScript on Bun and call `muove` through its CLI and
JSON output. Decision logic moves into Muove rules either way (D-2).

Rejected:

- **Rust with the Muove crates embedded:** firn already runs on Bun
  (`native/firn_host.mjs`), Bun is Tom's default for JS and TS, and porting
  Beagle's emitted JS to TypeScript is mechanical.

### T2. Idiomatic Nix layout once identity is proven

The emitter keeps Beagle's byte layout through WP4, because byte identity is
the migration proof. After WP4 it switches to idiomatic `let … in` in one
commit, verified by whiterabbit's drvPath and by the capture check of PLAN
box 4.15.

Rejected:

- **Beagle's layout permanently:** nothing depends on the bytes once the
  migration is proven, and `let` written as an immediately applied lambda
  makes the generated Nix hard to read.

### T3. Clause is frozen now

Clause gets no new features from today. nixos-config and north stay on their
current Clause pins until acceptance A3 (firn) and A8 (north) pass, and then
Clause is archived.

Rejected:

- **Keeping Clause alive in parallel:** north's adoption ratchet repinned
  Clause 29 times in 5 days (N8), and Muove takes over its role.
- **Retiring it only after both migrations, with no freeze:** new Clause
  features would widen what Muove must import.

## 3. Process notes

- **Where the inputs went.** They were moved from the container root into
  `main/` through an orphan lane. Both archives were extracted into fresh
  scratch directories, read, scanned for secrets, and imported as source
  (27 of 27 and 6 of 6 files).
- **What each reviewer saw.** Only `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md` (the
  migration-engineer lens) and Muove's own `inputs/`. No secrets,
  nixos-config or north files, transcripts, or `~/code/clients`.
- **Gemini terms.** Google may use Gemini prompts for training unless that is
  turned off in Antigravity's settings. Gemini received the SPEC.md text only,
  on Tom's named request.
- **Capacity.** The workers' capacity hook refused two of the five research
  workers at first (24–32% desktop pressure). Both ran a few minutes later.

## 4. Review record

Three reviews were run against the SPEC as it stood at 17:58, the
migration lens with PLAN.md as well:

- **Astra xhigh** through `codex exec` (`gpt-6-astra`), lens "language
  designer: soundness and expressiveness".
- **Astra xhigh**, lens "firn/north migration engineer: can this replace
  today's `.bnix` and Clause programs".
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro (high)** through `agy`, lens "adversarial: find the
  semantics holes".

Each finding was weighed by its evidence first: a failing scenario counts
whoever raised it. Every finding came with a scenario that fails against the
reviewed text, so all 45 are accepted. Gemini's fixes and the self-review
fixes below landed while the Astra reviews ran, which is why three Astra
findings were already fixed in whole or in part.

| Reviewer | Findings | Severity | Accepted | Rejected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini, adversarial | 9 | 2 critical, 3 high, 3 medium, 1 low | 9 | 0 |
| Astra, language designer | 18 | 2 critical, 10 high, 5 medium, 1 low | 18 | 0 |
| Astra, migration engineer | 18 | 1 critical, 12 high, 5 medium | 18 | 0 |

### 4.1 Gemini, adversarial

| ID | Finding | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BooleanLiterals | The menu rule filters on `contains(…)`, but no rule literal accepts a boolean expression | SPEC §4.3 and §9.4: a boolean expression is a literal that holds when it is `true` |
| NixInFacts | A tag override's `[pkgs.firefox]` is a `Nix` value, which could not enter a fact | SPEC §3.2: opaque `nix T` payloads that can be stored, bound and emitted, never decided on |
| UndefinedTagRelation | `_generated-enables` read `gets … set to … by`, which `firn/tags` never declared | SPEC §9.6: the shapes and the `tag-overrides` rule |
| MissingQuerySyntax | `all … where …` was missing from the grammar | SPEC §9.4: `query` |
| MissingAggregateSyntax | `aggregate` was referenced but not defined | SPEC §9.4: `aggregate`, including argmin |
| NestedForSyntax | A `for` block could not nest inside an entry | SPEC §9.4: `for-block` is an `entry` |
| UnquantifiedAmong | `among ?key lies in ?room` broke the explicit-quantifier rule | SPEC §6.2: `requires` and `among` bind their own variables |
| MenuEmptyReject | Moving the selection in an empty menu rejected, where Clause admits an empty step | SPEC §9.7: `may skip`; §5.3: the importer marks every handler `may skip` |
| MissingArgsParamSyntax | `args` and `param` were not defined | SPEC §9.4: both rules |

### 4.2 Astra, language designer

| ID | Finding | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LD-01 | A membership `?t in [?s ++ "x"]` in a recursive rule grows text forever | SPEC §4.3: no value invention covers memberships, calls and head expressions; PLAN 3.2 tests it |
| LD-02 | `invariant every Clock ticks happens when Clock is ready` makes admission depend on itself | SPEC §6.3: invariants and `ensures` take state claims only (D-30); PLAN 7.2 |
| LD-03 | A query inside a definition hides a negative cycle (`chosen` from `not chosen`) | SPEC §4.3: a query in a rule counts as an aggregate over what it reads; PLAN 3.2 |
| LD-04 | `?x = ?y` with `?y = ?x` passed the safety check | SPEC §4.3: safety by a grounding schedule; PLAN 3.2 |
| LD-05 | Searching only `"ok"` proved `never compromised` while the runtime admitted `"boom"` | SPEC §5.5: closed and open slots, the event alphabet in every answer (D-26); PLAN 7.4 |
| LD-06 | Views and handlers queried `M(static)` | SPEC §4.5: a query's context decides its model; "known" means evaluated by Muove (§3.2) |
| LD-07 | `delete` left the entity live, and an include could resurrect its facts | SPEC §5.3: `(live \ D) ∪ C`, and an include of a non-live entity rejects; §4.1: static facts cannot mention state entities |
| LD-08 | The allocator was outside the state, so equal states could allocate differently | SPEC §5.1: the allocator is in the state, its hash and checkpoints (D-31); PLAN 7.3 |
| LD-09 | Nothing could emit the flake root, which is not a module | SPEC §9.4 and §10.2: `nix file` (D-25); PLAN 4.5, 8.10 |
| LD-10 | Under negation, a hitting set of current supports need not break the claim | SPEC §6.4: hitting sets for monotone cones, verified search otherwise, and the edge cases; PLAN 3.14 |
| LD-11 | §8.5 forbade the ordinary approval that §5.6 gave `library-ladder` | SPEC §8.5: a patch that fixes every failure is approved normally |
| LD-12 | A requirement that keeps failing can hide a new failing host | SPEC §8.4: comparison by failing instance (D-29); PLAN 6.3 |
| LD-13 | Two equal `set`s conflicted only when already satisfied | Already fixed before the review returned (S1): withdrawals apply before inclusions, so both starting values admit |
| LD-14 | Argmin ties were undefined | Ties already fixed (S5). Added: with no candidate, argmin binds nothing |
| LD-15 | `sum` could overflow or not depending on order | SPEC §4.3: exact sums with one range check; aggregates range over distinct bindings; PLAN 3.4 |
| LD-16 | Rename-insensitive identity hid renames that change emitted Nix | SPEC §8.1: only unobservable names are normalized away; PLAN 6.1 |
| LD-17 | `matches the menu query` dropped its north, so one north's query matched another's rows | SPEC §9.7: `matches the menu query of ?north` |
| LD-18 | The Dedalus correspondence ignored rejection | SPEC §5.3: it covers the post-state only; admission is Muove's own |

The designer also confirmed the dungeon by its own search over 19 states:
the room set, the Library checkpoint, the warning requirement, the Iron-Key
failure, the ladder repair and the four Silver-Key placements all agree.
Its shortest witness takes 5 steps, not the 6 the SPEC listed, so §5.6 now
gives the 5-step witness, which the ChatGPT oracle's room path confirms.

### 4.3 Astra, migration engineer

| ID | Finding | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | firn's three Clause programs, north's `flake.clause`, the rest of north and Clause's removal had no boxes; A8 meant two things | PLAN 4.10–4.12, 8.10, 8.12–8.15; SPEC §13: A8 is the menu slice and A11 is north replaced; §10.4: `muove run` and `muove query` for firn's TypeScript host |
| M02 | The Nix front-end covered only kanata's subset | SPEC §10.2: `nix file`, `with`, `//`, nested modules; PLAN 2.2, 2.3, 4.2 |
| M03 | Attribute names and attribute paths were conflated | SPEC §3.1: `OptionPath`, and the attribute-name rule for text and entities |
| M04 | `contains` and `lowercase` had no signatures, and Clause parity was unchecked | SPEC §3.5: signatures, with Clause as the reference; PLAN 8.4, 8.6 |
| M05 | The menu view read the static model | As LD-06 |
| M06 | An empty move rejected where Clause skips | `may skip` was already added (MenuEmptyReject). Added: replay compares admission results (SPEC §10.4) |
| M07 | Derived relations change when maintained values become visible | SPEC §9.7 and D-28: import with maintenance handlers in order, then refactor under replay at transaction boundaries |
| M08 | Deletion and empty creation were underspecified | As LD-07. SPEC §4.1: `create` sets every non-`maybe` field, and the importer's rule for Clause `one` fields |
| M09 | F64 to Int and the FIFO rewrite had no preservation contract | SPEC §10.4: the 2^53 integer check, and FIFO rules imported as written |
| M10 | An effect list could admit what the mailbox rejected | SPEC §5.4: `at most one per step` |
| M11 | No path for existing north checkpoints, the allocator or pending effects | SPEC §5.4 and §10.4: `settled by`, pending effects, checkpoint contents, `muove import clause-checkpoint`; PLAN 8.11 |
| M12 | Comparing `Menu` views alone misses admissions, effects and restarts | SPEC §10.4: the observation contract, the entity correspondence and coverage; PLAN 8.5, 8.7 |
| M13 | The drvPath cannot certify modules no host enables | SPEC §10.2 and A3: per-module parse identity, listed with drvPath coverage; PLAN 4.7, 4.13 |
| M14 | The baseline was mutable, and the 63-to-50 mapping was implicit | PLAN: pinned worktrees (D-32), and the manifest box 1.5; Appendix A re-checked at `10740a8a` |
| M15 | `fmt`, the schema and Beagle's tools had no boxes | SPEC §2 and §9.4: `foreign`; PLAN 2.13–2.15, 4.9, 4.16; D-27 |
| M16 | Packages missed dependency edges | PLAN: a Needs column on every box, checked for cycles |
| M17 | Several Done whens did not measure their claim | PLAN: the firefox review replaces the no-op mako change; contracts in 6.5; replay, not handler counts, in 8.7; named rejection scenarios in 7.2; latency in 6.7 and 8.9; A9 names `why --all` |
| M18 | Boxes averaged 25.8 minutes | PLAN: 92 boxes of 20 minutes or less (19.5 on average), plus the north slices that 8.12 sizes |

### 4.4 Revisions made before the reviews returned

The lead's own pass, while the reviews ran:

- **S1.** The step's conflict rule became Dedalus's withdraw-before-include,
  with conflicts found by modes. The old rule rejected `withdraw X` with
  `include X` and a `set` to the current value.
- **S2.** `exactly one` takes a single entity key.
- **S3.** Every claim is evaluated over the transition system; a program
  without events has one state.
- **S4.** `requires` and `among` quantify their own variables, and vacuous
  claims are marked.
- **S5.** Argmin syntax, with a canonical tie-break.
- **S6.** `muove build` refuses to emit while a derived mode Fails.
- **S7.** Opaque `nix T` payloads (with NixInFacts).
- **S8.** The tags vocabulary was completed: `supports`, `sets … to … for`,
  `gets … set to … by`.
- **S9.** The claim grammar.
- **S10.** `the ?x where …` in views.
- **S11.** The text built-ins.
- **S12.** `--allow-requirement-changes` for derived patches.
- **S13.** Entity field access, `?x.field`.
- **S14.** The canonical value order.
- **S15.** The slot-token rule.

Also: empty `min` and `max` bind nothing; `delete` and `create` of one
entity in one step is a static error; two tag overrides of one path refuse
to emit; the `why` example uses firefox, because kanata is set in its host
module rather than enabled by a tag; and the drvPath gate covers whiterabbit
only, as nixos-config's AGENTS.md requires.
